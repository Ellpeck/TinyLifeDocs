# Tiny Life Release Survey

Tiny Life is currently in open beta, but within the next year, we'd like to release a full, paid version of Tiny Life for desktop devices and consoles. For this process, we'd like some feedback from people that may be considering buying the full version once it's released.

Thanks for your feedback!
