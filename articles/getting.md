# Getting Custom Content
You can get custom lots, households and mods from [the community](https://itch.io/board/1032686/mods).

Installing a mod or other custom content is pretty simple:
- Find the `Tiny Life` folder by following [this simple guide](game_dir.md)
- Find the `Mods` (or `Custom Lots` or `Custom Households`) folder in there
  - For mods, if you received it as a `zip` (or any other kind of archive), extract it first, and then put the mod's `dll` as well as its `Content` folder into the `Mods` folder.
  - For custom lots and households, simply put the `json` file(s) you received into the respective folder.

Done! Now just start the game and the added content should automatically load. If there are any errors, they'll be logged in the most recent file in the `Tiny Life/Logs` folder.
