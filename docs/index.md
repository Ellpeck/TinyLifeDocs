Welcome to the Tiny Life Developer Docs! On here, you can find the full modding API documentation, as well as links to various modding tutorials and additional information to what you can find on [the wiki](https://wiki.tinylifegame.com).

## Contributing
If you found an error in the game's API or its documentation, please feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/Ellpeck/TinyLifeWeb/issues). 

If you've made a mod for Tiny Life before, and you think you know what you're doing, you can help others by contributing your own tutorial articles or improving existing ones. You can get started doing so by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/Ellpeck/TinyLifeWeb/pulls). If you do, please start out with a draft pull request, so we can communicate about your plans for the content you're contributing. 

Please keep in mind that some content, especially information meant for all players (rather than just developers), may fit better on [the wiki](https://wiki.tinylifegame.com) than this site.

Since the API documentation is generated automatically, the `docs/api` directory in the repository should not be edited through pull requests.
