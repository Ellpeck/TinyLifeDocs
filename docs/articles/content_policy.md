# Tiny Life (Custom) Content Policy

*Please read this document carefully before sharing videos, livestreams, mods, custom maps, households, or lots. By sharing content on any of the officially supported distribution platforms, you also agree that you have read all the information below.*

As part of the goal of Tiny Life's design, we want to foster a community of players that are accepting, kind and have the ability to express their creativity and explore their identity. As such, the following rules are very permissive of custom content of any kind, with restrictions that aim to minimize unease or harm in the community.

All content that does not follow these rules will be removed from the official distribution platforms, and their authors may be banned for a period of time at the moderators' discretion.

## Tiny Life Content on the Internet
- ✔️ You are free (and encouraged!) to create videos, livestreams, blog posts, and other content that shows off Tiny Life and its gameplay. When doing so, be sure to make it sufficiently clear that the content you are showing off is associated with Tiny Life.
- ✔️ You are free to share any custom content of any kind for Tiny Life outside the official distribution platforms. When doing so, be sure to make it sufficiently clear what parts are your creations, and what parts are Tiny Life's original content.
- ❌ You are not allowed to reupload or otherwise redistribute the Tiny Life binary, assets, or code. If you want people to be able to find the game easily, it is recommended that you link to its website https://tinylifegame.com.

## Tiny Life Content on Official Distribution Platforms
Tiny Life's official distribution platforms include [the itch community](https://ellpeck.itch.io/tiny-life/community), [the Steam workshop](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651490/Tiny_Life/), and [the Discord](https://ellpeck.de/discord). For these platforms, there are a multitude of additional rules.
- ✔️ You are free (and encouraged!) to share videos, livestreams, blog posts, and other content that shows off Tiny Life and its features, with the community through the official distribution platforms.
- ❌ You are not allowed to share mods or other types of custom content that suggest or attempt removing or hiding features from the game that support body positivity, bodily autonomy, queer representation, gender equality, and racial diversity.
- ❌ You are not allowed to share mods or other types of custom content that promote or engage in criminal activity, including but not limited to illegal drug use and abuse of minors or adults.
- ❌ Due to the game's age rating and target audience, you are not allowed to share mods or other types of custom content that depict activities and situations not suitable for all ages. This includes explicit sexual activity, abuse of drugs or alcohol, as well as possibly triggering topics like references to intense emotional trauma.
