# Getting Custom Content
You can get custom lots, households and mods from [the community](https://itch.io/board/1032686/mods).

Installing a mod or other custom content is pretty simple:
- Find the `Tiny Life` folder by following [this simple guide](game_dir.md)
- Find the `Mods` (or `Custom Lots`, `Custom Households` or `Custom Maps`) folder in there
  - For mods, if you received it as a `zip`, just put it straight into the `Mods` folder. If it's any other kind of archive, you need to extract it first, and then you can put the mod's `dll` as well as its `Content` folder into the `Mods` folder.
  - For custom lots and households, simply put the `json` file(s) you received into the respective folder.
  - For custom maps, simply put the `zip` archive you received (or the three map files as described in [the custom maps article](custom_maps.md)) into the `Custom Maps` folder.

Done! Now just start the game and the added content should automatically load. If there are any errors, they'll be logged in the most recent file in the `Tiny Life/Logs` folder.
