# Getting Custom Content
You can get custom lots, households and mods from [the Steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1651490/workshop/), [the Discord server](https://link.tinylifegame.com/discord) and more.

## Installing from Steam workshop
To install a mod or other custom content from the Steam workshop, all you have to do is select the item you want to install, and then press the big green "Subscribe" button! After a few seconds or after restarting the game, the item should appear in-game.

If there are any errors or your items don't appear in-game, it'll be logged in the most recent file in the `Logs` folder in the [game folder](game_dir.md).

## Installing manually
Installing a mod or other custom content is pretty simple:
- Open the `Tiny Life` folder by following [this simple guide](game_dir.md#from-within-the-game).
- Find the `Mods` (or `Custom Lots`, `Custom Households` or `Custom Maps`) folder.
  - For mods, put the `zip` archive straight into the `Mods` folder.
  - For custom lots and households, put the `json` file(s) into the respective folder.
  - For custom maps, put the `zip` archive into the `Custom Maps` folder.

Done! Now just start the game and the added content should automatically load. Again, if there are any errors or your items don't appear in-game, it'll be logged in the most recent file in the `Logs` folder in the [game folder](game_dir.md).
