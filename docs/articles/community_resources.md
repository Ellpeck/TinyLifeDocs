## Tutorials
### McChicky's Modding Tutorials
McChicky's tutorials have easy-to-follow descriptions and lots of screenshots, so they're especially recommended for people just starting out with Tiny Life modding.
- [Creating a Basic Hair Mod from Scratch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vShsxqDFy4TqvOG_eq5kpD5gnMvCJ4to0CdC_PnFHjfPTdVJIDMPbdsqVqI-hPHuMeYXMQitesvSbQ7/pub)

### Miscellaneous Tutorials

## Utility Mods
### Simple Object Loader
The modder [Sir-Fenrir](https://github.com/Sir-Fenrir) is working on a cool mod that allows easily creating simple custom objects including furniture, tiles, wallpaper and more, all through JSON files rather than C# code. To get started, check out the mod's [documentation](https://github.com/Sir-Fenrir/simple-object-loader/blob/main/README.md) and download it on the [workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3117181034).
