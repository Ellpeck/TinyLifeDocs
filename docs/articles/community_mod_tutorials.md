# Community Modding Tutorials
Similarly to how the [Community Showcase](https://tinylifegame.com/community/) is dedicated to showing off some of the amazing content that the Tiny Life community has created for the game, we want to use this section to showcase some of the tutorials and helpful bits of content that Tiny Life modders have created.

Of course, please take care when using these resources, as their content may be incorrect or outdated. That being said, as far as we're aware, all of these resources abide by the [Tiny Life Content and Community Policy](https://docs.tinylifegame.com/articles/content_policy.html).

**If you're interested in having your content added to this page, please let us know on [the Discord server](https://link.tinylifegame.com/discordweb) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/Ellpeck/TinyLifeWeb/blob/main/docs/articles/community_mod_tutorials.md).**
