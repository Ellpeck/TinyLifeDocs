    <h1>About Tiny Life</h1>
    <p>Tiny Life is a fun simulation game that aims to capture the essence of games like The Sims, but in an isometric pixelart style.</p>
    <p>In the game, you control a set of people that live together in a household. You take care of their daily needs, build their skills, forge new relationships... or just mess up their entire life in whatever way you can think of!</p>
