    <p>Along with every major update, we publish a devlog that features additional information as well as some screenshots. Occasionally, we also post about the game's development or other news. You can read them on itch or on Steam. You can also read <a href="https://docs.tinylifegame.com/Changelog">the full changelog</a> or subscribe to <a href="#subscribe">the mailing list</a>.</p>
