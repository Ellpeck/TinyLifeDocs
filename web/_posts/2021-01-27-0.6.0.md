A new update for Tiny Life just launched, and this is a pretty big one! To sum up the changes in one beautiful sentence: We now have romance, dating, beautiful plants and trees around the map, the ability to level up in your job and earn more, and a lot of sounds for various occasions!

But first: Between the last update and this one, I also created a trailer for the game! It doesn't showcase all of the features that are present in this update, but it does showcase a very cool building montage.
