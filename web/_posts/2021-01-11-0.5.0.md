People can gain emotions through certain events (like cleaning disgusting dishes, having a boring day at work, reading a good book or being seen while on the toilet), and emotions affect people for a certain amount of time. Below are some screenshots to show the emotions, as well as some other, neat new stuff!

Jessica is uncomfortable because she had to do the dishes. Oh no!

Jessica is embarrassed because something awkward happened in the bathroom, and that's not all...

The character creator got a little upgrade: The preview pictures now look a lot nicer!

You can now set the genealogy of your household members. (This doesn't do much yet, though.)

And lastly, there's a new house and household on the default map. Check it out by starting a new save file!
