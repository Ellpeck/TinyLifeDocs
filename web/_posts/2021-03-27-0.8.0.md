I've been taking a little break from Tiny Life development over the last month or so due to exams and just general life stuff. There were, however, a few pretty major things I did before taking this break. Now, I finally got around to releasing a small update all about them!

Mail carriers will not come into your town every Monday and deliver your bills!   You'll be able to assign a mail carrier from any of your exported households.

In the future,   it'll also work this way for things like bartenders on bar lots, librarians etc, so you'll be able to curate a friendship with people that run businesses and they won't randomly get replaced by other people.

There are now hints that display in the loading screen, giving you some useful information about the game that you might not know yet.    There aren't that many right now, but with every update, I'll be adding more related to the new content.

Additionally, I updated all of the screenshots on the main page to reflect the content and looks of the new versions. I tried to keep the basic theme of the screenshots the same, so they should look like overhauled versions of the old screenshots. You can check out the main page for all of them, but here's my favorite one.
