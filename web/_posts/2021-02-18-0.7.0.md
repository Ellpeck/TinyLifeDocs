The new version, 0.7.0, adds a ton of new content, and also a bunch of fixes to the game! As always, the full changelog is at the bottom and in the game's main menu, but there are a few things that are better explained using screenshots.

Probably the biggest change is that stuff can now break, and if it does, it will have to be repaired! If you try this and fail, it's probably a good idea to  take a break if you get stunned.

The cooking skill will now have more of an effect on the food you create: Similarly to paintings, your food will now have a quality rating. Based on the quality, people will react with happiness or disgust.

You can now learn to code, and in doing so, gain the ability to hack other people for a little bit of profit. Something interestin also happens if you fail, but I don't want to spoil it here. Try it out for yourself!

Along with some more new features, there are also some visual improvements, like a nice border that makes the map not seem like it's a flat plane floating in space anymore.

Lots can now be named in build mode as well, and the name will display when trying to visit the lot.

One of the new pieces of furniture that were added was long overdue: A single bed! This one is a variation of the modern double bed, but of course, there will be more styles of beds and other furniture in the future.

The main menu also got an upgrade: Seeing which save file is which will now be a bit easier to see, as the last played household will be displayed in  the list. Note that this only happens after you first opened a save in the new version and selected a household.
